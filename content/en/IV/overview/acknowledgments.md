MIMIC is made available largely through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and collaborating research groups.  

Our work is supported by grants from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award numbers R01-EB001659 (2003-2013) and R01-EB017205 (2014-2018).  

If you use our data, code, or algorithms, please provide a citation to this project. Citations are the primary mechanism through which we demonstrate the impact of MIMIC and justify continued research funding.

## MIMIC Code Repository

The [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code) provides code and example usage of the MIMIC-IV database, and is described in [the open access publication here](https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocx084). If you use any code in the repository, we would appreciate if you would cite the publication as follows:
