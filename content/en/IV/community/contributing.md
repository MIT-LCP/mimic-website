MIMIC is provided through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and [our collaborators](/iv/overview/acknowledgments/). We have limited resources and cannot provide individual support to researchers worldwide. We therefore encourage MIMIC users to work together as a community.
The [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/) contains collaboratively developed code for a large number of useful concepts in MIMIC.
The issues page provides a forum for public discussion which reaches a larger audience, enables wider discourse, and full transparency around discussions.

## How do I raise an issue on the MIMIC Code Repository?

To raise an issue, first navigate to the [MIMIC Code Repository issues page](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/issues).
After logging in to GitHub, click "New issue", add a title and description of the problem, and then select the "Submit new issue" button.

## How can I help to improve the MIMIC website and documentation?

Content for the MIMIC website and documentation is hosted publicly on GitHub: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-website.

To raise a problem or to suggest an improvement, please create a new issue at: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-website/issues

To fix an issue or to contribute new content, please either select the 'Edit this page' item in the left hand menu of the website or [submit a pull request in GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## How can I share code that I have written for MIMIC?

We encourage you to share the code that you use for analyzing the data. We currently collaboratively develop code in the MIMIC Code Repository:
https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code

## Do I need to contribute my code to the MIMIC Code Repository?

Of course not - feel free to start your own repository! Be sure to tag it for discoverability - for example, on GitHub, you can use the `mimic-iii` tag.
