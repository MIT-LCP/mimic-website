## Working with waveforms

An in-depth tutorial for working with physiological signals from the MIMIC-IV Waveform Module can be found here: 
https://wfdb.io/mimic_wfdb_tutorials/intro.html. This tutorial was created for a workshop at the
[EMBC](https://embc.embs.org/) in 2022. The tutorial investigates approaches for estimating cuffless blood pressure
from the MIMIC-IV Waveform Database.
