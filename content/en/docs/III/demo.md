The MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) Clinical Database contains comprehensive clinical data relating to tens of thousands of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. The MIMIC-III demo database is limited to 100 patients and excludes the noteevents table.

The demo dataset (v1.4) can be downloaded either as 25 comma-separated-value (CSV) files or as a single Postgres database backup file (Postgres 9.5). Scripts for building a local copy of the MIMIC-III database using the CSV files are available in the [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code).

## Accessing the demo data

- Navigate to the project page on PhysioNet: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/
- Scroll to the "Files" section to view and download the data.
