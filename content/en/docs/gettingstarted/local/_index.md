## Data and build scripts

MIMIC is provided as a collection of comma-separated (CSV) files, along with scripts to help users import the data into popular database systems. 

Instructions and build scripts for MIMIC are available in the [MIMIC code repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code) for Postgres, MySQL, and Oracle:
