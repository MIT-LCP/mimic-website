MIMIC is made available largely through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and collaborating research groups.  

Our work is supported by grants from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award numbers R01-EB001659 (2003-2013) and R01-EB017205 (2014-2018).  

If you use our data, code, or algorithms, please provide a citation to this project.
