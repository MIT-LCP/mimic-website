# Detailed Description

DATETIMEEVENTS contains all date measurements about a patient in the ICU. For example, the date of last dialysis would be in the DATETIMEEVENTS table, but the systolic blood pressure would not be in this table. As all dates in MIMIC III are anonymized to protect patient confidentiality, all dates in this table have been shifted. Note that the chronology for an individual patient has been unaffected however, and quantities such as the difference between two dates remain true to reality.

## `SUBJECT_ID`, `HADM_ID`, `ICUSTAY_ID`

Identifiers which specify the patient: `SUBJECT_ID` is unique to a patient, `HADM_ID` is unique to a patient hospital stay and `ICUSTAY_ID` is unique to a patient ICU stay.

## `ITEMID`

## `CHARTTIME`, `STORETIME`

`CHARTTIME` records the time at which an observation was charted, and is usually the closest proxy to the time the data was actually measured. `STORETIME` records the time at which an observation was manually input or manually validated by a member of the clinical staff.

## `CGID`

`CGID` is the identifier for the caregiver who validated the given measurement.

## `VALUE`

## `UOM`

## `WARNING`, `ERROR`

## `RESULTSTATUS`, `STOPPED`
